This folder contains synthetic data set containing 25 example dogs named after past presidential dogs. 

**It is not real data!**

There should be no significant difference in expression between patients or histologies.

The data fits the requirements for the pipeline:
1) each dog has at least 3 samples (one each of Benign, Malignant, and Normal histology).
2) for each sample, we provide the dog of origin, the sample ID, and the histology.
3) RNAseq (synthetic, with no true information or signals in the data) is provided for each sample.
